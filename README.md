Road Accident Analysis – Data Visualization & Predictive Modeling

Add This as Description (copy below):

I recently worked on a Data Analytics & Visualization project titled “Road Accident Analysis – India 2023”, where our team analyzed nationwide accident data using Power BI and built a Random Forest model to predict accident trends for 2025.
Our project identified accident hotspots, risky vehicle categories, and high-severity highways, giving valuable insights for policymakers and road safety planning.

Tech Used: Power BI, Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
