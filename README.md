🚗 Road Accident Analysis – India (2023)

A comprehensive Data Analytics and Visualization project that examines India’s 2023 road accident data using Microsoft Power BI and predicts 2025 accident trends using a Random Forest machine learning model. This project highlights accident hotspots, risky vehicle categories, and state-level patterns to support road safety improvements.

📌 Key Features

Accident Hotspot Analysis – Identify states with the highest accident and fatality rates.

Vehicle-wise Fatality Comparison – Understand high-risk vehicle categories (two-wheelers, cars, buses).

State-level Trends – Compare injuries & deaths across Indian states.

Highway Risk Comparison – Analyze accident severity across NH, SH, and Expressways.

Predictive Modeling (2025) – Random Forest model forecasting injury and fatality trends.
